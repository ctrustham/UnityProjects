# Modular Sprite Sheets

Modular Sprite Sheet - a demonstration of dynamically created sprites and sprite-sheets. Contains two scenes:
Scene 1) simpleSpriteSheetAnim - demonstrates a menu for changing an animated character's head colour (can be easily be expanded to change or replace any/all body parts)

scene 2) ModularSpriteSheet - creates a sprite dynamically by combining other sprites to create a texture.
